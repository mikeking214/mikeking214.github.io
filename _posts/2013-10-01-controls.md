###Mechanical Engineering Capstone Project

*"Team project work typically involving the design, fabrication, verification, and application of a mechanical device or system"*

For my senior capstone project, I worked with <a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="http://speal.ca">Nicholas Speal</a>, Patrick Abouzakhm, and Matthew Mayers to design the control system and propulsion for the autonomous underwater vehicle being built by <a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="http://mcgillrobotics.com">McGill Robotics</a>.  We were responsible for dynamically modeling the robot, choosing an appropriate style of control, simulating the controls in an underwater environment, and implementing it into the vehicle.  Using an iterative approach, we made many assumptions to create a simple version, test it, expand upon the assumptions, and repeat until we had a system with precision that met our needs.  The system was written in C++ and used ROS to integrate with the other sections of the software system.  The software system is still being tested and the control system continues to be improved as we collect more data.

As I am also the mechanical division leader at <a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="http://mcgillrobotics.com">McGill Robotics</a>, I have the responsibility of leading the mechanical design and manufacturing of the vehicle and continuing to work on the control system until the competition in July.  

*I've written details about the McGill Robotics team and their competition [here](/projects/mcgillrobotics).*
