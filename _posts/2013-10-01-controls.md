###Mechanical Engineering Capstone Project

*"Team project work typically involving the design, fabrication, verification, and application of a mechanical device or system"*

***

For my senior capstone project, I am working with <a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="http://speal.ca">Nicholas Speal</a>, Patrick Abouzakhm, and Matthew Mayers to design the control system and propulsion for the autonomous underwater vehicle being built by <a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="http://mcgillrobotics.com">McGill Robotics</a>.  We are responsible for dynamically modeling the robot, choosing an appropriate style of control, simulating the controls in an underwater environment, and implementing it into the robot.  Using an iterative approach, we make many assumptions to create a simple version, test it, expand upon the assumptions, and repeat until we have a system with precision that meets our needs.

As we are all also leaders at <a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="http://mcgillrobotics.com">McGill Robotics</a>, we have additional roles building the robot, meaning the final product will be a functioning robot with control in an underwater environment.
