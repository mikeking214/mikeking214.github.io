###Mechanical Engineering Lead

######As mechanical engineering lead at McGill Robotics, I am in charge of the design and manufacturing of an autonomous underwater vehicle, as well as the management and delegation of thirty engineering students working on the mechanical systems of the robot.

#####The Team

This year, I helped the robotics design team re-brand to McGill Robotics and expand from 40 to 98 committed members, due to a deliberate effort to market ourselves and recruit the increasing number of interested students.  With increased professionalism, publicity, and success, we are able to give many more students access to invaluable engineering experiences.  We hope to see McGill Robotics expand in the coming years, to compete in more competitions and get more people excited about robotics.

#####The Competition

The <a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="http://robosub.org">AUVSI Foundation's RoboSub Competition</a> in San Diego is the top international competition for university robotics teams building autonomous underwater vehicles.  The challenge is to build a fully autonomous robot that can navigate underwater and complete various tasks that involve responding to and interacting with its environment.  For example, the AUV must pass through gates, respond to light signals, locate an object near an acoustic pinger, shoot torpedoes at targets, and pick up items off the bottom.  As the competition takes place at the end of July, I will continue to work with the team through the summer.

##### *April Update

The vehicle has been tested, both wet and dry, and we are confident we will have a working machine by July.  The mechanical systems are completed, but a second iteration of some parts are being manufactured.  The electrical division continues to improve cable management and connection issues to increase the robustness of the system.  Autonomy is not ready yet, as we continue to gather camera and sensor data for processing, but computer vision, planner, controls, and state estimation have been successfully integrated.  With further mechanical improvements, new waterproof connectors, and more testing, we hope to have an autonomous vehicle by mid June.
