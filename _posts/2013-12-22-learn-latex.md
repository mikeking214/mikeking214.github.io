If you've ever received a university level math or science assignment or read anything published in an academic journal than you've seen the results of LaTeX, and you would likely recognize its fonts and formatting.

###What is LaTeX?

LaTeX (pronounced lay-tek, NOT lay-teks) is a digital typesetting system, which produces high quality professional documents, typically in .pdf format. Rather than typing your document into a word processor, like Microsoft Word, the content of the document is written in plain text into a text editor, along with some code to provide instructions.  Everything is compiled using the LaTeX engine, which understands your code, applies the proper formatting, and outputs the final document looking professionally produced.  LaTeX is very common in the academia world for assignments, papers, exams, and research, and is often used for resum√©s and small books.  It requires a small learning curve, as it is a type of markup language, but the benefits are well worth it.

####History
*<a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a>, one of the most well known computer scientists to this day, wrote a series of books on computer programming in the 1970s and was so frustrated with the quality of the output by the electronic publishing tools that he spent years creating a better system.  This would become TeX, a complex system to give full control over document layout that would later be simplified by *<a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport">Leslie Lamport</a> to become the LaTeX system used today.  

####Advantages
What sets LaTeX apart from standard WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) word processors like Microsoft Word or Open Office, is how it decides to process and format your content.  LaTeX takes the document as a whole and all its features into account and processes them through very fine-grained algorithms, to precisely format the text, paragraphs and pages the same way a professional publishing company would.  Word processors on the other hand format on the fly, disregarding how the document should look as a whole and requiring the user to think about formatting as they type the content.  Any user of Word understands the frustrations of fitting paragraphs on a page, aligning text, referencing figures, adjusting the size and look of titles and sections, and simply undoing all the autoformatting that Word forced upon you. Each of these issues force the user to edit the formatting as they create the content, and likely it will need to be tweaked repeatedly as the rest of the content is created.  In LaTeX, you write in plain text, so the formatting is not considered when actually writing, and you simply define headers, sections, figures, and equations using commands that already have their own formatting.  rLaTeX is essentially a markup language, like HTML with CSS, and analogous to writing a web page.  Like HTML, the content is mixed with commands, or tags, and is not WYSIWYG.  Like other types of code, LaTeX must be compiled, or processed, to create a usable output.  This
