####My Decision
The first offer came from a <a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="https://www.cra.com">Boston-based software company</a> with a small auxiliary Research & Development team that works on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles.  I would have the opportunity to design, build, and test out on the water - a dream  scenario for me that would combine my passions.  The down side is that they're located in Rhode Island--not my New York City dream.

Another offer came from the founder of a 3D printing venture capital fund who recently started a <a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="http://www.imakr.com">3D printer retail store</a> in SoHo, New York. He was looking to build up a technical team to work on the printers and help customers, so he contacted me for an interview.  He wanted me to come on as the second engineer, in a technical support role, with the opportunity to grow a team of engineers as the industry expanded.  

The last offer I got came from a <a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="http://www.inchnyc.com">small product development consultancy</a> in Brooklyn, where the CEO wanted me to come on as an intern.  I would have the opportunity to work on a whole range of projects, designing, prototyping and bringing to market innovative products--something I've considered to be my dream job for while.  

The decision was certainly difficult, but I felt super lucky to even have some offers to choose from.  I could have had only one offer and felt inclined to take it regardless, or have gone even longer without anything.  I dug up a tool I learned in school and made a weighted pro and con list--a 'Pugh Matrix' actually--to help make my decision.  

All signs pointed to the ocean engineering job in Rhode Island.  This was contrary to my initial reaction to the offer, but aligned with my current gut feeling.

The 3D printer job lacked enough of my interest and salary, and although the product development consultancy remains the ultimate end goal to my career, it didn't feel right starting there with no other experiences to shape my abilities [plus the very low starting intern wage].

The job in Rhode Island seemed to me to be the best launching point for my career; given the caliber of the company, the respect and difficulty of the industry, my interest in the work, and the opportunity to explore a new area while I was still not tied down anywhere.  It also starts as a six month internship, so I would have to the opportunity to make another decision later on as to where my career will head.

After getting these offers within the span of a week, it was time to make a decision the following week.  After accepting the offer with <a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="https://www.cra.com">Charles River Analytics</a>, I received their formal offer and company information and was excited to see how legitimate they were--compared to my other two very informal offers.
