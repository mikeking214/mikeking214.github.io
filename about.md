I grew up on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, studied mechanical engineering at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and I have recently accepted an ocean engineering job in Point Judith, RI.  I have a passion for design, I'm obsessed with efficiency, and believe everything should balance function with art.  When I'm not working on one of my many projects, I enjoy photography, music, web design, graphic design, working out, and cooking. I also love anything I can do outside, and spend every minute I can near the ocean.
