I'm from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where I've lived all my life, and currently finishing my Mechanical Engineering degree at McGill University in Montreal.  When I'm not studying or working on one of my many projects, I enjoy photography, music, web design, graphic design, working out, and cooking. I also try to be outside as much as possible, and go home to be near the ocean as often as I can.
