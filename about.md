I grew up on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, studied mechanical engineering at McGill University in Montreal, and currently work as an engineer in Snug Harbor, Rhode Island.  I have a passion for design, I'm obsessed with efficiency, and believe everything should balance function with art.  When I'm not working on one of my many projects, I enjoy photography, music, restoring bikes and furniture, web design, snowboarding, volleyball, working out, and cooking. I especially love anything I can do outside, and spend every minute I can near the ocean.
