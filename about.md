I'm from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where I've lived all my life, but I have recently settled in New York City, following my studies in Montreal, Canada.  When I'm not studying or working on one of my many projects, I enjoy photography, music, web design, graphic design, working out, and cooking. I also try to be outside as much as possible, and go home to be near the ocean as often as I can.
