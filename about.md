I'm from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where I've lived all my life, but I am currently traveling in California following my participation in a robotics competition in San Diego. As I recently graduated from McGill University with a Bachelors of Mechanical Engineering, I am actively looking for a full time position in the engineering design field.  When I'm not studying or working on one of my many projects, I enjoy photography, music, web design, graphic design, working out, and cooking. I also try to be outside as much as possible, and go home to be near the ocean as often as I can.
