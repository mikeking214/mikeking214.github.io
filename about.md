I'm from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where I've lived all my life, and currently finishing my Mechanical Engineering degree at McGill University in Montreal.  I am passionate about engineering design and particularly interested in the fields of robotics and human computer interaction.  I also love photography & anything to do with the ocean.
