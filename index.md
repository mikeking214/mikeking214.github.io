I am a mechanical engineer at <a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="http://cra.com">Charles River Analytics</a> in Snug Harbor, R.I., designing, building, and testing technologies for unmanned underwater vehicles and human applications. I am lucky to be practicing what I spent years studying--technical engineering design--while also living the fantasy of working outside and on the ocean everyday. 

While I love my job I am continuously looking for opportunities to stretch my mind and expand my abilities. I try to keep at least one side project going at a time and am always looking for more. *Please get in touch if you have a design idea or want to collaborate.*  I enjoy everything from web design to furniture building.
