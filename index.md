I am a recent graduate of McGill University passionate about engineering design, specifically <a markdown="0" href="{{ site.url }}/projects/mcgillrobotics">robotics</a> and <a markdown="0" href="{{ site.url }}/projects/brailleuniversity">human computer interaction</a>. 

After an amazing summer <a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca">researching at McGill University</a>, leading <a markdown="0" target="_blank" href="http://www.mcgillrobotics.com">McGill Robotics</a>, and traveling across the country, I have moved to New York City to pursue my passions and seek full time employment in the engineering field.
