###Interdisciplinary Design Project

*"Completion of an individual project on an interdisciplinary theme with emphasis on a balanced combination of analysis and synthesis"*

######Under the guidance of Donald Pavlasek and Professor Jeremy Cooperstock, a fully functional prototype was designed and manufactured from scratch within a 7-month production period.

The device is a mechanism that fits in the sole of a shoe and dynamically simulates the friction of a full range of surfaces.  The motivation behind this device comes from the need for high-fidelity simulation environments for slip scenarios.  These are needed to improve balance for conditioning and rehabilitation reasons, with such a large number of the over-65 population suffering fall-related injuries.  Additionally, this device could be used in an augmented reality setting, for research and entertainment purposes.

#####The Device
To vary the coefficient of friction, a range of surfaces---from ice to concrete---is simulated using the combination of an adjustable, deformable high-friction material and a rigid, static low-friction material.  The height of the deformable brake is adjusted to transfer more weight onto it, and because the friction force is proportional to normal force on the brake, the coefficient of friction changes with its height.  The mechanism uses a central stepper motor to drive a series of gears and a lead screw embedded in each brake to change the height of the braking surface.  The drive system was designed from scratch and all the components were machined in-house from aluminum and stainless.  The mechanism was assembled and tested at McGill's [Centre for Intelligent Machines](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/sre/), and a publication is in the works pending the results of further tests.  Additionally, the mechanism is currently being processed for a patent.
